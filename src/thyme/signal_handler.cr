# Thyme runs in multiple processes (sort of):
# 1. the main daemon process - where the timer runs continuously
# 2. secondary processes - which start to send stop/pause/unpause to the main process
#
# SignalHandler is used for sending/receiving messages. Receiving should only be done
# on the main process. Sending should only be done on the secondary process.
